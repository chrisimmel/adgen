# AdGen - AI Video Ad Generator

An agentic system that uses LLMs and generative AI models to create short video advertisements with narration and music.

## Features

- **Agentic Workflow**: Uses LangGraph for orchestrated ad generation
- **Provider Agnostic**: Abstractions for LLM, video, audio, and music providers
- **Human Review Points**: Strategic approval points in the workflow
- **Markdown Output**: Generated concepts and plans saved as markdown files
- **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command line interface

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

3. **Generate an ad:**

   ```bash
   uv run adgen -b "We sell eco-friendly water bottles for athletes"
   ```

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:

- Provider preferences (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Video duration and quality settings
- Review and approval settings
